# US001 - Register skills


## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As a Human Resources Manager (HRM), I want to register skills that a collaborator may have.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

**From the specifications document:**

> MS has a wide range of employees, who perform different types of functions.
> Besides have a main occupation the employees also have a set of skills that enables them to take on certain tasks and responsabilities, such as driving different type of vehicles, operating machines and more.

**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:** What criteria are necessary to register a skill?
>
> **Answer:** The only criterion is the skill name itself. Examples include "pruner", "heavy vehicle driver", "pesticide applicator".

> **Question:** What should the system do if the HRM tries to create a skill that already exists?
>
> **Answer:** Since skills are stored as a unique set (no duplicates allowed), the system won't allow creating duplicate entries.  Verifying duplicates is a technical concern, not a specific business rule.

> **Question:** Can I add skills by typing them in or uploading a file with all the skills?
>
> **Answer:** Both methods are acceptable. The choice depends on user experience (UX) preferences. Uploading a file might be faster for a large number of skills.

> **Question:** Can the HRM enter multiple skills at once?
>
> **Answer:** No, the current system doesn't require batch entry for skills.

> **Question:** Is the skill identifier the name itself, or does the system generate an ID?
>
> **Answer:** The skill name itself acts as the identifier. There's no separate ID generation planned currently.
